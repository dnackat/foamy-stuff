### OpenFOAM cases

This repo contains *OpenFoam* cases that use geometry created using *FreeCAD* or *Salome* package in Linux and meshed with either OpenFoam's native meshing tools or with *cfMesh*.
Some cases have been run with the CfdOf module, which is wrapper for OpenFoam built on top of FreeCAD. 

Post-processing is done with *ParaView* but results might not have been saved in these directories.   

**Status**: *In progress*
